Welcome to my Game Automation Testing Repository! üéÆ Here, we focus on ensuring the quality and reliability of the game application through automated testing methodologies. This repository includes advanced techniques such as the Page Object Model (POM), reusable codes, and seamless integration with Maven for efficient and effective testing workflows.

Key Features:

Page Object Model (POM): This testing framework follows the Page Object Model design pattern, which enhances the maintainability and scalability of the test automation suite, with a clear separation between page objects and test logic.

Reusable Codes: This code emphasize the importance of code reusability to streamline the testing efforts. This repository contains a library of reusable codes and functions, allowing us to efficiently automate common testing tasks and scenarios across different game applications.

Maven Integration: Maven serves as the cornerstone of this build and dependency management process. With Maven integration, we can easily manage project dependencies, execute test suites, and generate comprehensive reports, ensuring a smooth and organized testing workflow.

Whether you're a game developer looking to ensure the quality of your applications or a tester interested in advancing your automation skills, my Game Automation Testing Repository has something valuable to offer. Join me in the journey to deliver high-quality, bug-free game experiences to our players!

Get started today by exploring my repository and contributing to the future of game automation testing.
